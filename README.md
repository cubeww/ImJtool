# ImJtool

ImJtool is a new IWBTG Fangame needle making tool. It's inspired by @patrickgh3 jtool and works to support more features and simpler usage.

## History

At first, the project was written in C++. Although it has implemented a lot of features, I had to give it up due to the **long compilation time** of the C++ project and some problems. Now the project is implemented using **MonoGame**, which is not only more powerful, but also easier to develop.
